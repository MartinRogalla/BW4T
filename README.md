#Blocks World for Teams(BW4T)
Blocks World for Teams (BW4T) is a testbed for team coordination. BW4T allows for games with human-human, agent-agent and human-agent teams of variable sizes. The goal is to jointly deliver a sequence of colored blocks in a particularorder as fast as possible. A complicating factor is that the players cannot see each other.

### <i class="icon-attention"></i>Git Rules
1. <i class="icon-lock"></i>*Never* push anything to the **master** branch. 
 > If you want to work on something as a **group**: [create a new branch][6], commit and add your changes and [create a pull request][5]. Only the git master is allowed to merge the changes to the master branch. **All other unauthorized commits on the master branch will be reverted.**
2. <i class="icon-fork"></i>*Never* branch off of the **legacy** branch.
 > Branch off of the *branch created by your group* or the *master branch* instead. The legacy branch 

3. <i class="icon-trash"></i> If you're done with your branch, *delete the branch*.
 >You can delete your local branch with `git branch -D BranchName`, where *BranchName* is the name of your branch. You can delete the remote branch by pushing the branch and putting a colon in front of the branch as such: `git push origin :BranchName`, where *BranchName* is the name of your branch.

4. <i class="icon-flash"></i> Never perform a *force-push*.
 >Never try to rewrite history in Git. This should be avoided at all costs. If you want to revert a specific commit, use the [`git revert`][4]. 

5. <i class="icon-fork"></i> If your branch is a second level branch, prepend the first level branch name.
 >So for example: in Group 1 we created a branch called `development` to do the refactoring. If I want to add some tests to the client and make a branch called `client_testing`, then the **actual name** has to be called: `development_client_testing`. 

### <i class="icon-help"></i>Git FAQ

 - Help! I accidentally changed a file, which I didn't intend to change. How do I get a copy of the file, as it was before?
 > Run [`git checkout -- /path/to/file/`][1] on the file you want to revert the changes. *Tip: accidentally changed all the classpath files and are you lazy enough to not checkout every single .classpath file? Make use of the wildcard like this: `git checkout -- *.classpath`*

 - How do I see what file(s) I changed?
>Run `git status`.

 - Think something should be added to this FAQ?

# Jenkins <i class="icon-flag-checkered"></i>
**Integration Testing** is done by Jenkins on our [Integration Server](https://martinrogalla.com/jenkins/). Whenever pushes to certain branches are made, the changes are pulled by the Integration Server. The Integration Server then runs all the tests via Maven and publishes the test results.
### <i class="icon-attention"></i>Jenkins Rules
 - <i class="icon-attention-alt"></i> It is *never* okay to have a build **fail**.
 > To prevent this, make sure you **run Maven before you push to a branch** *(`mvn clean install` or in Eclipse: Run As -> Maven Build...(goals: `clean install`))*. In the case that you do have a failing build, **make it your first priority, to fix the build**, before you continue any other work.(*reverting if necessary*)
### <i class="icon-help"></i>Jenkins FAQ 
 - What is the difference between Maven and Jenkins regarding testing?
>Jenkins runs maven whenever it gets a build request. It interprets the testing, checkstyle, coverage and findbugs results and keeps a history of the output generated by maven.

# Sonar <i class="icon-chart-bar"></i>
The **Code Analysis and Statistics** of BW4T is done by [Sonar](https://martinrogalla.com/gitlab/).
