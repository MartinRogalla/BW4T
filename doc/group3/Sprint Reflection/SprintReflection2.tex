\subsection*{Main problems encountered:}
\subsubsection*{Problem 1}
Description: ScenarioEditor had a dependency with the core which broke the continuous integration. \\
Reaction: We managed to figure out what caused the problem and fixed it.

\subsubsection*{Problem 2}
Description: Group 2 had their priorities wrong. Instead of finishing the Botstore they continued working on the handicap implementation and started with the EnvironmentEditor. This resulted in us not being able to finish all tasks.
Reaction: We'll have to make a better and clearer agreement with group 2. We also shouldn't wait till the end of the week, but start communication earlier on in the week.
