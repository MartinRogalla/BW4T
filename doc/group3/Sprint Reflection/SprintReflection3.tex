\subsection*{Main problems encountered:}
\subsubsection*{Problem 1}
Description: During the merge for the SIG deadline some of our changes we're lost \\
Reaction: We've had to implement those changes again as we were unable to find them in the GIT history.

\subsubsection*{Problem 2}
Description: During the integration with the BotStore and E-PartnerStore some functions turned out not to be implemented yet
Reaction: In order to finally be able to finish the Scenario GUI we decided to implement those ourselves.
