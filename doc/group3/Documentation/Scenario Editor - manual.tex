\section{Introduction}
This document describes how to make use of the Scenario Editor (Figure 1). When you open the editor, you see two main parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The Configuration panel, which is used to create, open and save configuration files.
\item The Entity panel, where a list of bots and a list of e-partners are being displayed. Here you can create, modify, rename and delete bots and e-partners.
\end{enumerate}

\section{General use}
At the top of the editor you can see a $File$ menu. If you click on that, you get the options to create a new configuration,open a configuration, save your configuration, export your configuration and to exit the editor.

On the left side of the editor you can configure a scenario as you like. The Client IP, the Client Port, the Server IP and the Server Port should already contain the default values. You can change them if you need to. You can also indicate whether you want to open a GUI, visualise the paths the bots take or enable collisions. If you have a map file you want to use, you can import it by selecting the $Open$ $file$ button at the right section.

On the right side of the editor you can create, modify, rename and delete bots and e-partners. There also are a list of bots and a list of e-partners that are created, and below each list there is an indication of how many bots or e-partners are created in total.

Linked to the Scenario Editor are the Bot Store and the E-partner Store, which will also be discussed in this document.
