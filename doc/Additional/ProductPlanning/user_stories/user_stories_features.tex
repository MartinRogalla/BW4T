  \item[Story 1.1:] Configuration Files (Scenario GUI)\\
  As a user\\
  I want to have a scenario GUI\\
  So that I can easily make custom configurations that are read by GOAL to create maps

  \begin{description}
    \item[Scenario 1.1.1:] Configuration changing\\
    Given the user has started the program\\
    When the user has launched the GUI\\
    Then the user can change the settings from a standard map to create a map with an entirely new set of configurations
    
    \item[Scenario 1.1.2:] Room count\\
    Given the user has changed the room count\\
    When the user presses the create map button\\
    Then the configuration file created contains that amount of rooms\\
    And the map shows that amount of rooms when loaded as environment
    
    \item[Scenario 1.1.3:] Bots\\
    Given the user has launched the scenario GUI\\
    And the user has specified how many bots\\
    When the user presses the create map button\\

    \item[Scenario 1.1.4:] Human Players\\
    Given the user has launched the scenario GUI\\
    And the user has specified which bot is human controlled\\
    When the user presses the create map button\\

    Given the user has launched the scenario GUI\\
    And the user has created the map they wanted\\
    When the user presses the create map button\\

  \item[Story 1.2:] Human Player GUI\\
  As a user \\
  I want to control the bot via the human player GUI\\
  So that I can tell the bot what to do

  \begin{description}
    \item[Scenario 1.2.1:] GUI starting\\
    Given a map with at least one human player has been created\\
    When the map is used in a GOAL multi agent system\\
    Then there should be a human player GUI launched for every human player given in the map
    
    \item[Scenario 1.2.2:] Control\\
    Given the human player GUI has started\\
    When the user clicks a command given in the list of possible commands\\
    Then the bot executes that command and the GUI shows this as feedback

    \item[Scenario 1.2.3:] Message sending\\
    Given the human player GUI has started\\
    When the user makes a message and sends it\\
    Then the GUI should show this message as being sent
    
    \item[Scenario 1.2.4:] Message receiving\\
    Given the human player GUI has started\\
    When the user receives a message made by another human player GUI\\
    Then the GUI should show this message as being received

    \item[Scenario 1.2.5:] Visual Feedback\\
    Given the human player GUI has started\\
    When an event has occurred that limits or extends the bots commands\\
    Then the list of possible commands in the GUI should be updated

  \item[Story 1.3:] E-Partner\\
  As a user\\
  I want to be able to use my E-Partner\\
  So that I can assist bots and use the E-Partner as my assistant

  \begin{description}
    \item[Scenario 1.3.1:] Starting the E-Partner\\
    Given the GOAL multi agent system is launched\\
    And there is an E-Partner in the map\\
    When a bot picks up the E-Partner\\
    Then the E-Partner should be started and all its features should be unlocked for the bot that has picked it up
    
    \item[Scenario 1.3.2:] Control\\
    Given the user holds the E-Partner\\
    When the user executes an action to move the block representing the E-Partner\\
    Then the block moves in the given direction
    
    \item[Scenario 1.3.3:] Communication (sending)\\
    Given the user holds the E-Partner\\
    When the user types in a message to send to another E-Partner\\
    And the user clicks to send the message\\
    Then the typed message is sent
    
    \item[Scenario 1.3.4:] Communication (receiving)\\
    Given the user holds the E-Partner\\
