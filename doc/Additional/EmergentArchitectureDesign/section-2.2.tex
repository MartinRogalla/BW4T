BW4T will mostly be running on a single PC. Because of the Server-Client architecture, it is possible to run the server and the client(s) on different PC's. There are no special requirements. Both the server and clients can run on the same or different types of computer. The other subsystems like the map editor can run on any PC with Java 6 installed.
