\section{Wendy's learning goals}
\\

My learning goals for this project were:\\
\\
• Learn to work with Latex\\
• Learn to work with GitHub \\
• Gain as much project-experience as possible, as I am going to need it next year for my minor\\
\\
I think I reached my learning goals with success:\\
\\
• I am able to make simple documents in Latex now. A team member told me about ShareLaTex and I think it is really handy, I even used it outside this project already.\\
• I am finally able to work with GitHub without tons of conflicts everywhere. I worked with GitHub before but because of all the problems I got, I was a bit afraid to use it again. With this project I was forced to use GitHub again and I am glad I had to. Now I can pull, commit and merge without problems and I even learned to work with Git Shell. \\
• I also gained a lot of project-experience. We used a lot of handy project tools (like Trello, Google Spreadsheets, GitHub) and because we were with so many (19 students) a lot of organization was necessary. \\
\\
Except from this learning goals, I also learned other things which I did not think of beforehand: \\
\\
• I learned unit testing.\\
• My java programming got way, way better than before the project.\\
• I executed my first user tests.\\
