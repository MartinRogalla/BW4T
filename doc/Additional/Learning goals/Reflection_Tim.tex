\section*{Reflection}
I have surely learned how people work in teams on large software systems. This is the first time that I work together with a team larger than five people, and the first time that I work on a software system that is going to be used after we are done with it. The scale of the project required us to use Scrum as a development method, so I surely have learned how someone can use Scrum to develop large software systems within a relatively short amount of time. I have also learned how to use multiple design and test principles that were covered in the SQT and SEM courses, so I fulfilled that learning goal as well. Learning to work with Git was mainly achieved by trying to demolish Git as much as possible at the start of the project, so the learning goal concerning that is achieved as well. Only the goal of optimizing my communicative skills remains, and I didn't spend a lot of time on achieving this goal. I, however, think my communicative skills are alright as is: I was the leader of my group during the MAS project of the first year, and I have mainly practiced my communicative skills there. This goal was, therefore, less important to me than the other goals during this project.
