\section{Environment Store}
In the beginning of the project de customer made clear what their desires were for the Environment Store. These are listed below:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Random Map Generator
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Number of Maps
		\item Number of Rooms
		\item Number of Bots
		\item Blockades
		\item Without constraints like of for example a maximum of 26 columns
	\end{itemize}
	\item Make a map by hand
	\item Save Environments
\end{itemize} 

All these things are roughly implemented as they are described. 
I will walk them through, not completely in the right order. \\
\indent The creating of maps by hand is changed completely. Before we changed it it simply asked for a number of rows and columns and then generated rows of rooms with a drop zone on the bottom. After that you could determine what blocks every room contained and in what sequence they had to be collected. All that is left of this is is the grid which is generated by the number of rows and columns that are specified. This grid is empty, this means that every place is a corridor. Then rooms can be added in every space by hand. Also the spawn points of the bots can be determined and the drop zone can also be placed wherever the user likes. Extra additions are blockades and charging zones. The charging zones are because the bots got batteries which need to be charged somehow. The reason we implemented it like this because the grid we use already existed and could easily be adapted to a fully custom made map. The maximum number of rows and columns is not removed but it is raised to 100. We did not make this unlimited because it would simply get too big and you coul not get a clear overview of the map.\\
\indent The Random Map Generator is an option in the map editor. At this point the number of rows and columns of the grid is already specified. In this generator the rooms are still added like rows of rooms and not completely random locations because you would get too many unsolvable maps. The user is not able to set the number of generated rooms because this is decided randomly. So every time you generate the map you get a slightly different number of rooms. This was done to improve how random the generated maps are. The number of bots is also not generated here. We chose not to because the bots were added in the Scenario Editor. We left out the option to automatically create a certain amount of maps at once. This is because the way we do it now you can generate a map and after that easily make additional changes. Of course the maps the user creates can be saved and easily loaded in the BW4T environment.\\
