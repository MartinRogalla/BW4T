\section{Hardware/software mapping}
In this project there is no need to discuss hardware. While we do have a Client-Server relation, we run it on a single computer, so for all practical purposes there is no need for different hardware. It is, however, possible for clients to connect to a remote environment.

The software architecture is shown in chapter 2.1. We are planning on refactoring the code to this structure first, because there are currently many illogical connections between client and server.
