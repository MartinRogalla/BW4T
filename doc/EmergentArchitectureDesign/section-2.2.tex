\section{Hardware/software mapping}
In our project their is no real hardware that we should discuss in this document. We have offcourse a client - server relation, but we run it on 1 computer, so there is no real "hardware" communication. 

The software architecture is shown in 2.1. We are planning on refactoring the code to this structure first, because there where many illogical connection between server and client.
