\subsection{Paul â€“ Professor}
Paul is a professor in Artificial Intelligence at the Technical University of Eindhoven. He teaches students in Computer Science who are in their second your of their bachelor program the course Engineering Multi-Agent Systems and together with his students he participates in different Multi-Agent and Robotics competitions because he thinks it is most important that the Technical University of Eindhoven spends much research in this field. This way he tries to exploit the possibilities of agents and artificial intelligence together with his students. 
To make Multi-Agent programming accessible to his students, Paul would like to use a system that is easy to use for the students but has limitless possibilities in ways of programming the agents. Furthermore, Paul would like to use the system to do research on Human-Computer Interaction and communication between different agents and would he like the simulations to be as realistic as possible concerning the different scenarios but does not value fancy graphics and animations. Paul is good with computers and assumes that his students are as well.
