\subsection{Jasper – Student}
Jasper is 18 years old, and is a first year student Computer Science at the TU Delft. He participates in the course Logic Based AI, and has to work with the GOAL programming language in the BW4T environment. The course is worth more points than it was last year (the previous course, Multi Agent Systems, was worth 3 points, while this new course is worth 5 points), so as an extra requirement to complete this part of the course, the bots all need to have a handicap, causing them to be unable to complete the problem individually but also causing them to be able to complete it as a team. To specify the required handicaps, Jasper uses the bot store built into the BW4T environment. 
He knows how to work with GOAL and the program itself, so that isn’t the problem. It needs to be clear for him how the handicaps are to be specified and what the handicaps do in terms of disabling the bots.
