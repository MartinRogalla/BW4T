	\item[Story 1.1:] Configuration Files\\
	As a user
	I want to make configuration files
	So that I can easily load configurations

	\begin{description}
		\item[Scenario 1.1.1:] Maps\\
		Given the user has launched the GUI
		And the user has created the map they wanted
		When the user presses the create map button
		Then a configuration file should be created and usable
		% Are these not acceptance criterias? 
		
		\item[Scenario 1.1.2:] Bots\\
		Given the user has launched the GUI
		And the user has specified how many bots
		When the user presses the create map button
		Then a configuration file should be created and usable

		\item[Scenario 1.1.3:] Human\\
		Given the user has launched the GUI
		And the user has specified which bot is human controlled
		When the user presses the create map button
		Then a configuration file should be created and usable

	\item[Story 1.2:] Human Player GUI\\
	As a user 
	I want to control the bot
	So that I can tell the bot what to do

	\begin{description}
		\item[Scenario 1.2.1:] Control\\
		Given the human player GUI has started
		When the user clicks a command
		Then the bot does that command and the GUI shows this as feedback

		\item[Scenario 1.2.2:] Message\\
		Given the human player GUI has started
		When an e-partner message has been sent
		Then the GUI should show this message

		\item[Scenario 1.2.3:] Visual Feedback\\
		Given the human player GUI has started
		When an event has occurred that limits or extends the bots commands
		Then the list of possible commands in the GUI should be updated
		\end{description}

	\item[Story 1.3:] E-Partner\\
	As a user
	I want to be able to use my E-Partner
	So that I can assist bots and use the E-Partner as my assistant

	\begin{description}
		\item[Scenario 1.3.1:] Control\\
		Given the user holds the E-Partner
		When the user executes an action to move the block representing the E-Partner
		Then the block moves in the given direction
		
		\item[Scenario 1.3.2:] Communication\\
		Given the user holds the E-Partner
		When the user types in a message to send to another E-Partner
		And the user clicks to send the message
		Then the typed message is sent

	\item[Story 1.4:] Simulation\\
	As a user
	I want to create simulation conditions
	So that I can easily create specific scenarios
	%When the user selects a handicap. For example: gripper, colorblind, size, speed, ability to walk, 
	
	\begin{description}
		\item[Scenario 1.4.1:] Gripper Handicap\\
		Given the handicap GUI has started before the simulation run
		When the user unchecks the ability for a bot to use its gripper
		Then when the simulation runs the bot should not be able to use its gripper

		\item[Scenario 1.4.2:] Colorblind Handicap\\
		Given the handicap GUI has started before the simulation run
		When the user unchecks the ability for a bot to see colors
		Then when the simulation runs the bot should not be able to differentiate between colors

		\item[Scenario 1.4.3:] Bot size\\
		Given the handicap GUI has started before the simulation run
		When the user changes the size of a bot
		Then when the simulation runs the bot should have that size and its restrictions

		\item[Scenario 1.4.4:] Bot speed\\
		Given the handicap GUI has started before the simulation run
		When the user changes the speed of a bot
		Then when the simulation runs the bot should have that speed

		\item[Scenario 1.4.5:] Ability to walk\\
		Given the handicap GUI has started before the simulation run
		When the user unchecks the ability for a bot to walk
		Then when the simulation runs the bot should not be able to use its gripper

		\item[Scenario 1.4.6:] Physical aspects\\
		Given the handicap GUI has started before the simulation run
		When the user checks the physical aspects of a bot
		Then when the simulation runs this bot can only continue its path as long as it does not collide with other bots who have the physical aspects checked as well
