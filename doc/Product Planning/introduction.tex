\title{Product Backlog}
\date{}
\maketitle

The product backlog section will contain the initial release plan and the user stories that describe some of the features we'd like to include in this release. In order to get a better understanding of the product's users while writing the user stories, some personas were invented. The user stories themselves will be about the product's features, defects, technical improvements and know-how acquisitions.

Finally the definition of done will be described by stating how many backlog items need to be finished, how frequent we aspire to have releases and how this is integrated with our sprints.
