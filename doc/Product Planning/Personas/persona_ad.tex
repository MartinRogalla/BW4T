\subsection{Ad â€“-- Researcher}
Ad holds a masters degree in Computer Science and is a researcher in Multi-Agent systems and Artificial Intelligence. Together with his research group, he does research from the Technical University of Delft to explore the possibilities and restrictions in the field of agents and robots. His research focuses on the analysis, modeling, and development of agent technology that integrates different aspects of intelligence such as reasoning, decision-making, planning, learning and interaction but also integrates aspects such as emotional intelligence. This multi-agent technology has been applied, among others, in micro-simulation of domains such as traffic, logistics and supply chain management, serious gaming, negotiation, socio-cognitive robotics, and user modeling. 
As a researcher, Ad would like to use software that is complex in its possibilities but easy to use. He would like to run different simulations multiple times and track results easily.
