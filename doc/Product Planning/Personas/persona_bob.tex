\subsection{Bob â€“-- PhD Student}
Bob is 27 years old en just finished with studying. He now owns a PhD in artificial intelligence programming. He lives alone in the city of Amsterdam and does not have a job yet. There is a competition coming up which he finds very interesting. In this competition you have to program an artificial intelligence for deep sea exploration. He really likes the idea of deep sea exploration and decides to take part in the competition. 
For the programming and testing of his AI Bob decides to use the programming language goal and the BW4T environment. He decides on this because he has used BW4T a lot during his studies and is well aware of the environment. Bob can use BW4T to simulate and if he has to even control his agents. He can also change the environment to scenarios he desires. He can change lots of things like: the speed to the bots, how far they can see and even the distance they can communicate with each other. He hopes to simulate deep sea conditions with these features.
