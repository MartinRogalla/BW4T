\subsection*{Main problems encountered:}
\subsubsection*{Problem 1}
Description: Joop had to spend a lot of time on his Product Owner tasks leaving less time to actually program.

\subsubsection*{Problem 2}
Description: The final merge caused some minor problems causing some trouble with the first customer test. \\
Reaction: During the customer test some functions couldn't be tested. We tried to explain them as good as possible to try and give the customer an idea of the functionality. During the rest of the day a part of our group fixed all the problems.

\subsubsection*{Problem 3}
Description: With the final programming deadline fast aproacing we forgot to spend time on the final report.
Reaction: During the last day of the sprint (Friday) we spend a lot of time catching up and managed to finish a good part of report.
