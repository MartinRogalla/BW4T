\section{Hardware/software mapping}
BW4T will mostly be run on a single PC. Because of the Server-Client architecture, it is possible to run the server and the client(s) on different PC's. There are no special requirements. Both the server and clients can run on the same or different types of computer. 

The software architecture is shown in chapter 2.1. We are planning on refactoring the code to this structure first, because there are currently many illogical connections between client and server.
