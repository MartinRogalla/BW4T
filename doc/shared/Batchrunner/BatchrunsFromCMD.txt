How to run batch runs from the command prompt:

1. Dowload + install GOAL if you haven't done so yet (or reinstall so you don't have the 2k12 version).
	Go to http://mmi.tudelft.nl/trac/goal/wiki/Releases and under 'Legacy Downloads and Release Descriptions'
	press the download button on the latest release. Then install it from there.

2. Set required path variables.
	Start -> (right-click) Computer -> Properties -> Advanced system settings -> Environment Variables...
	From there you need to add the following to the END of your PATH variable (User variable), replace
	the beginning with your own path to the GOAL installation folder:
		;C:\Users\Nick\GOAL\swifiles\libs
	Now for the System variables; make a new System variable (not User variable):
		Variable name: SWI_HOME_DIR
		Variable value: C:\Users\Nick\GOAL\swifiles

3. Test.
	To test whether it worked correctly, open your cmd, navigate to the GOAL installation folder (cd GOAL) and
	execute the following command (replace Nick with your own name or change the whole path if needed):
		java -cp goal.jar -Djava.library.path=swifiles/libs goal.tools.Run C:/Users/Nick/GOAL/GOALagents/HelloWorld

You can now (hopefully) run batch runs from the command prompt.

If you wish to run them via Java, open the bw4t-batchrunner project and add the 'goal.jar', in your GOAL installation
folder, to the external libraries of bw4t-batchrunner's build path. From there just take a look at the Launcher class.
