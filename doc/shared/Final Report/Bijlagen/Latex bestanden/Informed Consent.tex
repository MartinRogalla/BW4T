You have been asked to be part of a usability evaluation of our new release from BW4T, which we made during our Contextproject. During this evaluation we will ask you the following things:

\begin{itemize}
\item Fill in a short questionnaire before and after the assignments
\item Complete a few assignments we give you, while 'thinking out loud'.
\end{itemize}

This evaluation is to test the system and not to test the user. So don’t worry when you can’t finish an assignment, there is no right or wrong. \\
\\
The software is new and untested, so problems may arise. \\
\\
Your participation in the evaluation is completely voluntary. You do not have to answer any questions you do not want to and you can stop at any time just by saying you want to stop. \\
\\
Your test results will be kept completely confidential. Your answers will not be linked to your name and will only be used for this evaluation. \\
\\
If you have any questions left, feel free to ask us. If everything is clear and you still want to participate in our evaluation, please mark the box below and fill in your signature. \\

$\square$ I read this informed consent and agree with participating in the usability evaluation. \\
