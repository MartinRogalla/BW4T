\textit{These are the wishes our participants expressed during the user tests.}
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item A one-click-random. It should be possible to randomize everything (zones, blocks and sequence) with one button. The result should be a resolvable map, so the randomize functions should keep eachothers results in account. For example: there cannot be a colour in the sequence which does not exist somewhere in a room.
\item Setting more zones at once. It should be possible to select multiple zones by dragging your mouse over them and then changing them all at once into rooms, blockades etc. This would be especially useful when having maps with a lot of zones. 
\item Being able to save the map without it having a start- and dropzone. 
\end{itemize}
