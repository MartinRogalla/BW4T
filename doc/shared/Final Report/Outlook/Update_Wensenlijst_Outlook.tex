\textit{These are the wishes our participants expressed during the user tests.}
\\
\begin{itemize}
\item A one-click-random. It should be possible to randomize everything (zones, blocks and sequence) with one button. The result should be a resolvable map, so the randomize functions should keep eachothers results in account. For example: there cannot be a colour in the sequence which does not exist somewhere in a room.
\item Setting more zones at once. It should be possible to select multiple zones by dragging your mouse over them and then changing them all at once into rooms, blockades etc. This would be especially useful when having maps with a lot of zones. 
\item Being able to save the map without it having a start- and dropzone. 
\item Being able to add parameters to the randomization of both the blocks and map. Example: different odds for reclassifying rooms as blockades/charge zones/corridors, a new probability that a corridor will be reclassified as a charge zone, and a different ratio (relatively) for every possible block color (the probabilities for the map randomization are hardcoded, as well as the ratios for each possible block color).
\end{itemize}
