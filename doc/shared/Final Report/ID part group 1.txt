\section*{Personas}
As can be seen in the attachments, our personas are all in the age of 18 – 60 and make use of the Blocks World for Teams environment. Obviously, the design of our graphical user interfaces, views and other choices are based upon this range of age. If, for example, we would have been developing this software for children aged 5 to 12, we could have chosen to make it more of a game. To do this, We could have introduced missions, where a bot has to perform several actions in in some specific order to make progress in the game. 
If it was based upon children in the age of 12 to 18, and it would be a game, we could have added more graphics and effects to make it more attractive to play. We could have made real buildings, with several stages and effects like burning trees or houses. A shaking screen as a cause of an earthquake, making it harder for the player to complete the game level. \\

On the other hand, if we had to develop this software for elderly people (age 60+), we probably would not even have thought about gamifying the software. Instead, other parts of the software would have changed. For example buttons would have been bigger so that it would be easier to click on them correctly. Text fonts would have been larger for them to be read more easily and maybe another font would have been chosen if it would turn out to be easier to read.\\

What we did not consider during the making of BW4T was the phenomena of colour blindness. One out of 12 men and 1 out of 250 women are colour-blind. Although the bots themselves are able to have the handicap colour-blindness, there is no option for researchers to choose an option colour blindness. In order to take this into account, blocks could contain numbers instead of having colours. Changing the colours would not have a significant impact, as there exist different kinds of colour blindness (source: \url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_blindness}). \\

After some tests with our client (K. Hindriks), he told us that he had a hard time seeing the colours of a button during the test. Therefore we are still considering a good and practical solution for this problem.\\

All our personas fall in the same category: they all know how to use goal and study artificial intelligence. If we would change the personas to people who would not do any research in or study artificial intelligence, we would probably get back to the “game” as described for children. We adjusted the user interface to a simple and intuitive user interface. The student and researchers should not have any problems finding features or using the program because of that. The logger gives a clear view of each bot. It says which bot did which action and it logs for each bot the amount of good block drops, bad drop blocks and especially how long it took the bot to finish the sequence. If our personas would not contain researchers, it would probably not matter that much how long it takes a bot to finish the sequence as for the student it is only important that the bot completes the mission.

\section*{User Scenario}
If we did not have a batchrunner, a small script that runs the program x times in a row on the background, it would have taken researchers huge amounts of time to run the program 1000 times. Not to mention putting everything together and analyse it afterwards. Without the map editor, users could only select the amount of rows and columns (which would turn out to be the amount of rooms). The user would not be able to really specify which rooms would be placed on what places and where the drop zone would be. \\

As this program is a helping tool for researchers, you don't want that agents just control your bots. In real life situations there are always humans involved, at least, nowadays, and probably in the future too. So there is a Human GUI (Graphical User Interface) which lets the user control a bot in the environment. \\

Even though we use bots which are probably capable of anything, there are still different kinds of bots. Robots come in all colours and sizes and therefor we want our bots to have some handicaps. In the Bot-store users are able to choose handicaps on robots, e.g. not being able to pick up a block or not being able to fit through a door of size x. This is very helpful for researchers as well, because they can analyse the difference in completion time when using different kinds of robots.
