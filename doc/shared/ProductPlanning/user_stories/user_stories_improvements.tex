    \item[Story 2.1:] Repast Stepper\\
    As a researcher into multi-agent systems\\
    I want to have a consistent simulation environment\\
    So that I can always reach the same final state if I were using deterministic agents.
    
        \begin{description}
        \item[Scenario 2.1.1:] Equal result\\
        Given the researcher has run a simulation using deterministic agents\\
        And the result was X\\
        When the researches re-runs the simulation\\
        Then the result should be X
        
        \item[Scenario 2.1.2:] Equal states\\
        Given the researcher is running a simulation on two seperate systems using deterministic agents\\
        When the researcher pauses the simulation at a specific tick\\
        Then the states on both computers should be equal
    \end{description}
    % Reclassified as an improvement, as it adds more realism to the
    % BW4T environment, which is a goal to be achieved.
  \item[Story 2.2:] Simulation (Handicaps)\\
  As a multi-agent systems researcher\\
  I want to create simulation conditions\\
  So that I can easily create specific scenarios
  
  \begin{description}
    \item[Scenario 2.2.1:] Bot store GUI\\
    Given the user has launched the scenario GUI\\
    When the user selects a bot from the list of bots in the scenario GUI\\
    Then the bot store GUI should be launched containing the settings for the selected bot
    
    \item[Scenario 2.2.2:] Gripper Handicap\\
    Given the bot store GUI has started before the simulation run\\
    When the user unchecks the ability for a bot to use its gripper\\
    Then during the simulation the bot should not be able to use its gripper

    \item[Scenario 2.2.3:] Colorblind Handicap\\
    Given the bot store GUI has started before the simulation run\\
    When the user unchecks the ability for a bot to see colors\\
    Then during the simulation the bot should not be able to differentiate between colors

    \item[Scenario 2.2.4:] Bot size\\
    Given the bot store GUI has started before the simulation run\\
    When the user changes the size of a bot\\
    Then during the simulation the bot should have that size and its restrictions

    \item[Scenario 2.2.5:] Bot speed\\
    Given the bot store GUI has started before the simulation run\\
    When the user changes the speed of a bot\\
    Then during the simulation the bot should have that speed

    \item[Scenario 2.2.6:] Physical aspects\\
    Given the bot store GUI has started before the simulation run\\
    When the user checks the physical aspects of a bot\\
    Then when the simulation runs this bot can only continue its path as long as it does not collide with other bots who have the physical aspects checked as well
