\item[Story 3.1:] Repast Stepper\\
As a researcher into multi-agent systems\\
I want to have a consistent simulation environment\\ So that I can always reach the same final state if I were using agents with a \gls{deterministic}.

\begin{description}
\item[Scenario 3.1.1:] Equal result\\
Given the researcher has run a simulation using deterministic agents\\
And the result was X\\
When the researches re-runs the simulation\\
Then the result should be X

\item[Scenario 3.1.2:] Equal states\\
Given the researcher is running a simulation on two seperate systems using deterministic agents\\
When the researcher pauses the simulation at a specific tick\\
Then the states on both computers should be equal
