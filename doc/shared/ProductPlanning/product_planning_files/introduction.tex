This report describes the product planning. It is built up by first giving a high-level product backlog, where the features that the stakeholders want are listed by their priority along with their relative time estimates. After establishing the items on the high-level backlog, the roadmap will be discussed. The roadmap describes how the product will be built and delivered over time, along with the release goals using a major release schedule.

The product backlog section will contain the initial release plan and the user stories that describe some of the features we would like to include in this release. In order to get a better understanding of the product's users while writing the user stories, some personas were created. The user stories themselves will be about the product's features, defects, technical improvements and know-how acquisitions.

Finally the Definition of Done will be described by stating how frequent we aspire to have releases and what needs to be finished at each release.
