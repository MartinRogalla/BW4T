Have I reached my learning goals? Yes. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item I learned how to work together as a team, and to be honest - never again! At least not in a team with a considerable amount of people. It was fun working in small groups, but the coordination between teams was poorly done and a lot of misunderstandings originated from that problem; we were just too many. 
    \item I also learned about how to apply Software Engineering principles in real life, and how to use different design patterns that exist. Design patterns such as MVC for GUI's or Decorator Patterns are beautiful concepts and enjoyable to implement, but when faced with big-sized UI's or giant classes to decorate, things tend to get tough. 
    \item I really like going through the Scrum process. It is well organized, and very nice to take part in. There were some issues, though, because we are still "beginners". Maybe with a little more experience, the project's process could have gone a bit better.
    \item I have now learned how to make proper use of GitHub thanks to this project. I see now how handy it can be. I will use it in projects of my own from now on. 
\end{itemize}
