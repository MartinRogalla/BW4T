> \textbf{Learning Goal Evaluation}
>   I more than exceeded the learning goals which I had set initially. I managed
>   to create a very nice setup with Jenkins, Maven and Sonar. Which initially
>   took quite some time to set up. I managed to create a multi-module Maven
>   project, which gets automatically pulled from the Git repository and then
>   built and tested on the Jenkins server. Afterwards Jenkins runs Sonar and
>   reports the code quality of the project.
