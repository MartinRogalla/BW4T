\section*{Core}
Moving on to the Core project. This project should be treated as a library for classes used by both the Server and the Client classes. It contains a relatively large map package, which consists of various classes used to draw the map on both the Server and the Client. In addition to the map package, the Core Project contains interfaces for the Server and the Client, called BW4TClientActions and BW4TServerActions respectively. These interfaces contain all methods that can be used throughout the entire project. This is why you encounter several objects of the type BW3TServerActions instead of the regular BW4TServer in the client code. The client can access the interface, but not the BW4TServer class itself.
