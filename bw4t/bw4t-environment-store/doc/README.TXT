The documentation is in the file CreateMap.odt inside a different project

BlocksWorldForTeam2/doc/instructions/CreateMap.odt

Sorry for the inconvenience, but project team decided to have 
one manual for all things and for ODT it's better
 to have all involved files together instead of distributed over projects.
